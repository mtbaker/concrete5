The Easter Bunnies were working overtime this morning trying to keep all the fresh falling snow from burying all the eggs!  With heavy snowfalls hitting up to an inch an hour, it took some diligent hunting to find the thousands of eggs worth more than $8,000 in prizes but the enthusiastic crowd of hunters did a great job.  After a day of finding eggs, folks are heading back to their cars late this afternoon. . . .and having to hunt for those too because of so much snow!    Check our website gallery page for some fun Golden Egg Hunt photos from today.\r\nThe recent spring storms have brought SO MUCH SNOW to Mt. Baker that it has allowed us resume our normal operation schedule and we will be open every day next week through April 3 for those on Spring Break! \r\n\r\n\r\nBaker reopened Thursday to 30 inches of fresh snow, and mountain forecasts are calling for continued snowfall throughout the week.  Heavy snowfall is expected the next few days with lowering freezing levels.  \r\nMt. Baker is operating 5 chair lifts daily from 9:00 to 4:00. As conditions allow through the month of April, Baker will operate our NORMAL SPRING SCHEDULE of Fridays through Sundays, plus BONUS MONDAYS! If current mountain forecasts hold true, there will be lots more time to get your powder turns in through the month of April! \r\n','7:54 am',1112025571,4,1,1,0,1,1),(287,'Please see below','9:00 am - 4:00 pm','14','STORM TOTAL;  30 inches','12','',29,'','Moderate','SNOWING',55,65,'POWDER','WITH ALL THE NEW SNOW WE HAVE HAD LATELY, MT.

This system is expected to move in late in the day Saturday with freezing levels dropping to 2000 feet for Sunday morning with fresh snow expected.  So it’s shaping up to be a nice – relatively calm weather day on Saturday – and then a fresh snow with calm air and cooler temps on Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our regular grooming, we will be WINCH CAT GROOMING on the more advanced runs of North Face and Austin for tomorrow and both the Chair 8 and Chair 3 TERRAIN PARKS HAVE BEEN REBUILT with more than 20 features up between the two.\r\n\r\nWe will be in full operation Saturday with all lifts running from 9:00 - 3:30 and both base areas open.

We will update this report with current weather info starting again this Thursday afternoon.\r\n\r\nWe have had a fabulous snow year this year and we currently have nearly 200 inches of snowbase at the lodge – this means great skiing and riding conditions on through the month.  \r\n\r\nWe also have some fun spring events scheduled starting with RAVEN’S EDGE SUPER G for advanced skiers and snowboarders coming up this Saturday and Sunday the 8th and 9th.  The RAVEN’S EDGE will be hosted by the Mt. Baker Race Team and registration is still open.\r\n\r\nAnd egg hunters get ready!  Saturday April 15th is the 6th annual GOLDEN EGG HUNT.  More than 5,000 eggs containing $5,000 in prizes will be hidden around the ski area with the Golden Egg Grand Prize containing a season pass to Mt. Baker for next season!\r\n\r\nAnd then on Saturday April 29th, plans are in the works for the first BAKER BOUNDARY BATTLE  randonnee challenge for skiers and split boarders.
